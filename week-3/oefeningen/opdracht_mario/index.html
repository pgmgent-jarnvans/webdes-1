                    <span class="first">I</span>n the early stages of developing Mario’s character Nintendo originally gave
                    him the name Jumpman.
                    Creator Shigeru Miyamoto also toyed with the idea of calling him Mr Video before finally deciding
                    to name him Mario after the landlord of their American Nintendo warehouse.

                    <span class="first">M</span>ario, under his original name Jumpman, made his first appearance as a side
                    character in the cult
                    classic Donkey Kong game created by Nintendo in 1981. In this game, Mario mistreated his pet Donkey
                    Kong causing the ape to kidnap his girlfriend.

                    <span class="first">W</span>e all know Mario and Luigi as Mushroom Kingdoms favourite plumbers, however,
                    Mario has had a few
                    career changes in his time. In Donkey Kong Mario is a carpenter, but in other games, he is a
                    medical physician, an archaeologist, champion kart racer, golfing aficionado and even the tycoon of
                    a successful toy manufacturing company.

                <h3>Goombas were the last enemies added to the game Super Mario Bros</h3>
                <img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/vsdebating/images/9/9c/Goomba_-_MarioPartyStarRush.png/revision/latest?cb=20170517155843"

                <p>
                    <span class="first">Y</span>up, the first enemy you encounter in Super Mario Bros. was actually one of
                    the last things added
                    to the game. At the last moment Miyamoto decided the game needed an easy enemy that could be killed
                    with a single hit, but cartridge space was so limited at that point that they needed to be as
                    simple as possible, so they basically created a little ball with eyes with a two-frame walking
                    animation. By the by, Goombas are called Kuribo in Japan, which basically translates to “chestnut
                    people”, so my friend that always called them raisins was wrong. I’m totally forwarding this to
                    him.

                <h3>"Yoshi" isn't Yoshi's full name</h3>
                <img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/mario-bros/images/b/b7/YoshiMP8.png/revision/latest?cb=20130703171829&path-prefix=nl"

                <p>
                    <span class="first">T</span>here are a lot of things we just sort of accept about Yoshi. For one, the
                    fact that he hatches
                    fully-formed out of the egg, complete with a built-in saddle. That, and we just sort of pretend
                    every dinosaur that comes out of a polka-dotted egg is named "Yoshi," even if that was the name of
                    the guy that got dumped in a bottomless pit two levels back. We can ignore these existential
                    questions because hey, it's a video game. No one was really asking what Yoshi's full name was, but
                    apparently someone at Nintendo thought that was a more important issue to address than a dinosaur
                    being born with shoes. An internal character guide unearthed by Blake Harris revealed something
                    startling about Yoshi. So, Yoshi's full name is... "T. Yoshisaur Munchakoopas." The T. is left
                    ambiguous, though we could guess it stands for "Transportation" or "Tyrannosaurus" or "Travis."
