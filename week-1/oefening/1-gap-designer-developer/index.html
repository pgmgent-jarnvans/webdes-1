  <h1>How Frontend Developers Can Help To Bridge The Gap Between Designers And Developers</h1>

  <h2>Looking Through The Eyes Of A Designer</h2>

  <p>
    Let’s for one moment imagine you were a designer and spent the last weeks — if not months — to work
    out a design for a website. You and your teammates went through multiple internal revisions as well as
    client presentations, and put a solid effort into fine-tuning visual details such as white space, font styles,
    and sizes. (In a responsive era — for multiple screen sizes, of course.) The <strong>designs have been approved</strong>
    by the client and were handed off to the developers. You feel relieved and happy.
  </p>

  <p>
    A few weeks later, you receive an email from your developer that says:
  </p>

  <q>Staging site is set up. Here’s the link. Can you please QA?</q>
  
  <p>
    In a thrill of anticipation, you open that staging link and after scrolling through some of the pages, you
    notice that the site looks a little off. Spacings are not even close to what your design suggested and you
    notice some kinks in the layout: wrong font faces and colors as well as incorrect interactions and hover
    states. Your excitement starts to slowly fade and turn into a feeling of frustration. You can’t help but ask
    yourself, “How could that have happened?”
  </p>

  <h2>The Search For Reasons</h2>

  <p>
    Maybe there were just a lot of unfortunate misunderstandings in the communication between the
    designers and developers. Nevertheless, you continue asking yourself:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      What did the the handover of designs look like? Were there just some PDFs, Photoshop or
      Sketch files shared via e-mail with some comments, or was there an actual handover meeting in
      which various aspects such as a possible design system, typography, responsive behavior,
      interactions and animations were discussed?
    </li>
    <li>
      Did interactive or motion prototypes that help to visualize certain interactions exist?
    </li>
    <li>
      Was a list of important aspects with defined levels of priority created?
    </li>
    <li>
      How many conversations took place — with both designers and developers in the same room
      together?
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Since <strong>communication</strong> and <strong>handover</strong> are two very important key points, let’s take a closer look at each.</p>

  <h2>Communication Is Key</h2>

  <p>
    Designers and developers, please talk to each other. Talk a lot. The earlier on in the project and the more
    often, the better. If possible, review design work in progress together early in the project (and regularly)
    in order to constantly evaluate feasibility and get cross-disciplinary input. Designers and developers
    naturally both focus on different aspects of the same part and therefore <strong>see things from different angles
    and perspectives.</strong>
    <br><br>
    Checking in early on lets developers become familiarized with the project so they can start researching
    and planning ahead on technical terms and bring in their ideas on how to possibly optimize features.
    Having frequent check-ins also <strong>brings the team together on a personal and social level</strong>, and you learn
    how to approach each other to communicate effectively.
  </p>
  <h2>Designers Expect The Frontend To Look (And Function) Like Their Design</h2>
  <h3>THE DESIGN FILE VS. BROWSER COMPARISON</h3>

  <p>
    A helpful technique to prevent designers from frustration is to make a simple left-right comparison
    between the design file you got handed over and what your current state of development looks like. This
    might sound trivial, but as a developer, you have to take care of so many things that need to function
    under the hood that you might have missed some visual details. If you see some noticeable
    discrepancies, simply correct them.
    <br><br>
    Think of it this way: Every detail in your implementation that looks exactly as it was designed <strong>saves both
    you and the designer valuable time and headaches</strong>, and encourages trust. Not everyone might have the
    same level of attention to detail, but in order to train your eye to notice visual differences, a quick round
    of Can’t Unsee might be a good help.
    <br><br>
    This nostalgically reminds me of a game we used to play a long time ago called “Find it”. You had to find
    discrepancies by comparing two seemingly similar images in order to score points.
    Still, you may be thinking:
  </p>

  <q>What if there simply is no noticeable system of font sizes and spacings in the design?</q>

  <p>
    Well, good point! Experience has shown me that it can help to start a conversation with the designer(s)
    by <strong>asking for clarification</strong> rather than radically starting to change things on your own and creating
    unwanted surprises for the designer(s) later.
  </p>

  <h2>Building Trust Between Designers And Developers</h2>

  <p>
    Having a trustful and positive relationship between the creative and tech team can strongly increase
    productivity and outcome of work. So what can we, as developers, do to increase trust between the two
    disciplines? Here are a few suggestions:
  </p>
  
  <ol>
    <li>Show an eye for details.</li>
    <li>Communicate with respect.</li>
    <li>Check in early on and regularly.</li>
    <li>Make yourself available.</li>
  </ol>
